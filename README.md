# DropIt
Anonymous Social Media App

App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drop-it!-join-conversation/id975681625?ls=1&mt=8

<strong>This app was previously on the App Store but due to Facebook closing down Parse, I have removed it from sale and currently working on a new version using PHP and Laravel 5.3 as the backend.</strong>

<b>Description</b>
